IBN Paper Table of Contents

1.	Introduction
	a.	5G and various vertical services (eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)
		i.	Delivering / supporting connectivity, automation and smartness 
	b.	Convergence with cloud and edge, VNF/NFV, SDN, slicing, etc.
	c.	The need for scaling (towards verticals) ….
	d.	IBN as a solution …. .
2.	Background & related work
	a.	Standardization (3GPP, IETF, GSMA, ETSI)
	b.	Research projects (5G-EVE, 5G-Transformer, etc.)
	c.	Other (?)
3.	IBN Enablers
	a.	AI/ML
	b.	Natural Language Processing (NLP) (incl. iterative interrogation)
	c.	Data models
	d.	Templates / Bleuprints (GST, 5G-EVE blueprints, etc.)
4.	IBN phases
	a.	Translation (walk-through and expected outcome)
		(Acquire necessary information from unskilled vertical user (Type of service, geo-temporal characteristics of service, KPIs, monitoring & security/privacy preferences))
	b.	Instantiation / Configuration
		(Create, deploy and configure necessary slices, components, VNFs, etc. according to requirements from user (Reserve and deploy network components, functions, interconnections, etc., define SLA, define LCM aspects)
		Use of Blueprints and templates).
	c.	Life Cycle Management (LCM)
		(Continuous monitoring of provisioned performance to ensure compliance with the user’s requirements  reconfigurations if necessary to provide the guaranteed SLA).
5.	Challenges 
6.	Conclusions
